<h1>Magic 8 Ball</h1> 
Here is the Surge link (the URL is funny, I know XD) :<h4>http://hospitable-camera.surge.sh/</h4>
I made this little project in April 2019. It's a fun <strong>Magic 8 Ball</strong> that predicts the future in a funny way :D 
I used a little bit of CSS animations and ofc my favourite JavaScript!
 <h3>HOW TO USE IT:</h3> 
Hover over the side of the ball like it's shown on the screenshot, for a few seconds while thinking about your question, 
then move the mouse to the side of the window to see the answer to your question !
Btw, on some browsers may happen a small glitch, when you hover on the ball for the first 2-3 times, but after that it works just fine.
ENJOY! :)
